                        <p>Thank you for choosing Cloud Coupons Now! We strive to provide you with the best deals and
                            discounts on web hosting services. We understand that sometimes things may not go as
                            planned, and we want to ensure that your experience with us is as smooth and hassle-free as
                            possible. Please read our Refund Policy carefully to understand our guidelines on refunds.
                        </p>
                        <h3>1. <strong>Refund Eligibility</strong></h3>
                        <p>Refunds are only applicable for specific products or services purchased through Cloud Coupons
                            Now that are eligible under the terms and conditions provided by the hosting providers. We
                            only offer refunds for services directly purchased from us. Coupon codes or discount offers
                            cannot be refunded, as they are provided as part of a promotion.</p>
                        <h3>2. <strong>Refund Process</strong></h3>
                        <p>If you are eligible for a refund, you must contact our support team within 30 days of your
                            purchase. Our team will review your request, verify your eligibility, and process the refund
                            according to the guidelines of the hosting provider. Please note that refund requests will
                            only be accepted if the hosting service provider has a refund policy in place for the
                            specific service purchased.</p>
                        <h3>3. <strong>Non-Refundable Products</strong></h3>
                        <p>Please be aware that the following are non-refundable:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Any third-party services or products not directly provided by Cloud Coupons Now.</li>
                            <li>Any subscription fees, once the hosting services have been activated or used.</li>
                            <li>Any services or coupon codes marked as final sale or promotional in nature.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>4. <strong>Refunds for Hosting Services</strong></h3>
                        <p>If you have purchased hosting services through Cloud Coupons Now, and the hosting provider
                            offers a money-back guarantee, we will assist you in processing the refund request. The
                            eligibility for a refund may vary depending on the hosting provider’s terms, and refunds are
                            typically processed within 7-30 business days after approval from the hosting company.</p>
                        <h3>5. <strong>Partial Refunds</strong></h3>
                        <p>In some cases, if a refund request is made after a partial usage of the hosting services, the
                            refund may be prorated. This means that the refund amount will be based on the unused
                            portion of the hosting plan.</p>
                        <h3>6. <strong>How to Request a Refund</strong></h3>
                        <p>To request a refund, please follow these steps:</p>

                            your account, depending on your payment provider.</p>
